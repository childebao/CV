What is this
------------

This is a repository that contains my up-to-date CV.

Building
--------

The CV is optimized to be built into a PDF using pdflatex.

In order to achieve this, you need:

   * A LaTeX distribution (install texlive-latex-extra on Debian/Ubuntu);
   * pdflatex (texlive-latex-base package on Debian/Ubuntu).

To build the PDF CVs, type `make`.
